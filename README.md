# Web Development

This repository documents my journey into web development.  
It contains structured notes, practice code, and small projects built while learning core frontend technologies.

## 📌 Purpose
- Learn web development fundamentals from the ground up  
- Practice concepts through hands-on examples  
- Build a strong base before moving into larger projects and frameworks  

## 🛠️ Technologies Covered
- HTML5 (semantic structure, forms, accessibility)
- CSS3 (box model, layouts, flexbox, responsiveness)
- JavaScript (basics, DOM manipulation, logic)
- Basic project structuring and best practices

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `html/` – HTML fundamentals and practice files  
- `css/` – styling, layouts, and visual experiments  
- `js/` – JavaScript basics and DOM-related code  
- `projects/` – small practice projects combining multiple concepts  

## 📈 Progress Philosophy
- Focus on clarity over shortcuts  
- No copy-paste without understanding  
- Incremental improvement over time  

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Responsive design and modern layouts  
- Advanced JavaScript concepts  
- Frameworks (React, etc.)  
- Backend integration (later stage)
